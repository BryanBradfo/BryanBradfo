## üë®‚Äçüíª Volunteering

### üåç AI for Good - ITU Young AI Leader (Hub of Paris)

As a **Young AI Leader for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) at the Paris-Hub**, I am actively involved in the **United Nations' AI for Good** program. Our team, the **Young AI Leaders of Paris**, is a group of dedicated young volunteers committed to promoting an **ethical, responsible, and human-centric artificial intelligence** for the common good.

We believe that while AI is rapidly transforming our societies, it remains largely misunderstood. Our mission is to **democratize access to a rigorous, accessible, and deeply humanistic AI culture**. We aim to bridge the gap in understanding for students, non-specialist researchers, and citizens, thereby reducing confusion and fostering engagement.

In this capacity, I collaborate with the team to:
*   **Engage with local organizations** to understand their on-the-ground realities and needs.
*   Explore how AI technology can modestly **contribute to supporting their missions**.
*   Develop concrete projects, such as our current exploration of a **solidarity chatbot** for individuals experiencing homelessness or extreme precarity.

Our approach is fundamentally **collaborative and field-driven**, ensuring that the solutions we explore are relevant and impactful. This engagement is a core part of my commitment to ensuring technology serves humanity and contributes positively to society.
